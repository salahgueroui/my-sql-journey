📂 My SQL Learning Journey Repository

This repository documents my SQL learning journey through the "SQL Bootcamp Playlist (2025) – Zero to Hero" by Data With Baraa.
It includes all tasks, exercises, and projects I complete as I progress from beginner to advanced SQL concepts.

⚠️ Note:
All databases used in this course are provided directly in the playlist videos by Data With Baraa.
I recreate these databases locally in SQL Server using the same scripts shown in the lessons.
